# Node Drive - Bug Fixes and Test Implementation Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Directory Navigation - Content Not Updating When href Changes ✅

**Problem:** When clicking on folders in the table, the URL would change but the content would not refresh, showing the previous directory's files.

**Root Cause:** The `App.tsx` component only fetched data once on mount (`useEffect` with empty dependency array), and didn't re-fetch when the route changed.

**Solution:**
- Added `useLocation` hook from `react-router-dom` to track route changes
- Updated `useEffect` dependencies to include `[location.pathname, location.search]`
- Added `setLoading(true)` at the start of fetch to show loading state during navigation
- Changed from `window.location` to `location` object for consistency

**Files Changed:**
- `/assets/src/App.tsx:1-96`

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Added import
import { useLocation } from "react-router-dom";

// Added hook
const location = useLocation();

// Updated useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    setLoading(true); // Show loading during navigation
    // ... fetch logic using location.pathname and location.search
  };
  fetchData();
}, [location.pathname, location.search]); // Re-fetch on route changes
```

### 2. Open File in New Tab Not Working ✅

**Problem:** Clicking on files was not opening them in a new tab as expected.

**Root Cause:** The `<a>` tag had `target="_blank"` but was missing the `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute, which is required for security and proper new tab behavior in modern browsers.

**Solution:**
- Added `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to the file link `<a>` tag
- This ensures proper security (prevents `window.opener` access) and consistent behavior across browsers

**Files Changed:**
- `/assets/src/components/files-table.tsx:174-188`

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
<a
  href={path}
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"  // Added this
  style={{ color: "#1890ff", fontWeight: 500 }}
>
  {name}
</a>
```

### 3. Provenance Card Not Showing When Clicking Badge ✅

**Problem:** Clicking on the provenance verification badge did nothing - the modal would not appear.

**Root Cause:** The `renderSimpleSide()` and `renderDetailedSide()` functions returned `null` when there was no manifest data loaded yet. Since `fetchProvenanceData()` is async, the modal would open but show nothing (empty body), making it appear broken.

**Solution:**
- Updated both `renderSimpleSide()` and `renderDetailedSide()` to show a loading state with spinner when `manifest` is null
- This provides immediate visual feedback that data is being loaded
- Modal now shows properly with a loading spinner until data arrives

**Files Changed:**
- `/assets/src/components/provenance.tsx:262-272, 387-397`

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
const renderSimpleSide = () => {
  if (!manifest) {
    return (
      <div style={{ padding: "40px", textAlign: "center" }}>
        <Spin size="large" />
        <div style={{ marginTop: 16 }}>
          <Text type="secondary">Loading provenance data...</Text>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
  // ... rest of the rendering logic
};

// Same pattern applied to renderDetailedSide()
```

## New Feature: Comprehensive Automation Tests ✅

### Overview

Added a complete end-to-end test suite using Playwright to ensure core functionality won't break in future changes.

### Test Coverage

#### 1. **Upload Tests** (`upload.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Single file upload
- ✅ Multiple file upload
- ✅ Upload progress indication
- ✅ Large file handling (100KB+)

#### 2. **Folder Operations** (`folder.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Create new folder
- ✅ Navigate into folders
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation back to root
- ✅ Delete empty folders
- ✅ Folder icon verification

#### 3. **File Operations** (`file-operations.spec.ts`)
- ✅ View file in new tab
- ✅ Download file and verify content
- ✅ Delete file
- ✅ Move/rename file
- ✅ Display file size correctly
- ✅ Display modification time

#### 4. **Navigation Tests** (`navigation.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Home page loads correctly
- ✅ Breadcrumb displays properly
- ✅ Browser back/forward buttons work
- ✅ URL updates when navigating directories
- ✅ Content refreshes when URL changes (validates Fix #1)

#### 5. **Provenance Tests** (`provenance.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Display verification badges for files
- ✅ Open provenance modal (validates Fix #3)
- ✅ Loading states in modal
- ✅ Folders don't show verification badges
- ✅ Download manifest JSON endpoint
- ✅ Hash information display

### Test Infrastructure

**Files Added:**
- `playwright.config.ts` - Test configuration
- `tests/upload.spec.ts` - 3 upload tests
- `tests/folder.spec.ts` - 4 folder operation tests
- `tests/file-operations.spec.ts` - 6 file operation tests
- `tests/navigation.spec.ts` - 4 navigation tests
- `tests/provenance.spec.ts` - 6 provenance tests
- `tests/README.md` - Complete documentation

**Total Tests:** 23 comprehensive end-to-end tests

### Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@playwright/test": "^1.56.1",
    "playwright": "^1.56.1"
  }
}
```

### NPM Scripts Added

```json
{
  "test": "playwright test",           // Run all tests headless
  "test:ui": "playwright test --ui",   // Run with UI mode
  "test:headed": "playwright test --headed",  // See browser
  "test:debug": "playwright test --debug",     // Debug mode
  "test:report": "playwright show-report"      // View report
}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not done)
pnpm install

# Install Playwright browsers (one-time)
pnpm exec playwright install chromium

# Build the frontend
pnpm run build

# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run with interactive UI (recommended for development)
pnpm test:ui

# Run specific test file
pnpm test tests/navigation.spec.ts

# View last test report
pnpm test:report
```

### Test Configuration Highlights

- **Sequential execution:** Tests run one at a time to avoid file conflicts
- **Auto server startup:** Rust server starts automatically before tests
- **Screenshot on failure:** Debugging made easier
- **HTML reports:** Detailed test reports generated
- **Retry logic:** Flaky tests retry in CI environments
- **Cleanup:** All tests clean up created files/folders

### CI/CD Ready

Tests are configured for CI environments:
- Set `CI=true` for stricter error handling
- Auto-retry on failures (2 retries in CI)
- Server reuse disabled in CI for clean state
- HTML reports generated for artifact storage

   - Large directory listing (1000+ files)
   - Large file uploads (>1GB)
   - Concurrent user operations

3. **Integration with CI/CD:**
   - Run tests on every PR
   - Block merges if tests fail
   - Generate coverage reports
